# AI Insights Roadmap Items

1. Define triggers for generating AI insights:
   - On task completion.
   - Weekly summary cadence.
   - When work is behind schedule.
2. Draft a prompt template that includes roadmap context and recent activity.
3. Decide where AI insights are stored (database table or activity log).
4. Define UI placement for insights (sidebar or activity feed).
